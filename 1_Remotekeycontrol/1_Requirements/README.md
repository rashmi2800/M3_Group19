# REMOTE KEY CONTROL 

## ABSTRACT 
Remote key control is an electronic key access control system that can be operated from a distance to perform specific function to the car. This RKE works by transmitting radio waves at a specific frequency,these frequency are used to remotely lock or unlock doors,and also helps the user to perform an action that causes a physical or software key fob to send a radio signal to a receiver that controls an electronic lock of the car. This is perfromed by pressing a button on a physical fob. 


## DEFINING OUR SYSTEM 
A remote keyless entry system consists of a remote that can lock, unlock, and perform numerous other activities within a car when activated within a defined range. At the touch of a few buttons, you can lock or unlock your car, open the trunk, start the engine, and perform some really fancy stuff (in high-end models). A short-range radio transmitter transmits radio waves to a receiver unit within the vehicle, which activates the aforementioned functions. So this project assists with automobile locking, unlocking, alarm activation/deactivation, and alert system. A led signalling system aids in the identification of the features. For instance, clicking once will turn on all of the LEDs, signalling that the car has been locked; similarly, pressing a button twice, three times, or four times would turn on all of the LEDs, indicating that the car has been locked.
